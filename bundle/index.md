The Bundles
===========

This framework provides several Symfony bundles that will help you to use JWS (signed tokens) and JWE (encrypted tokens).

Before to start creating your first tokens, we have to create an algorithm manager and keys or key sets.

* [Algorithm Management](jwa/index.md)
* [Header and Claim Checkers](checker/index.md)
* [Keys and key sets](jwk/index.md)

When your algorithm manager, yur checkers and your keys are ready, you will be able to create or load your first tokens.

* [Signed tokens](jws/index.md)
* [Encrypted tokens](jwe/index.md)
