Encrypted Tokens (JWE)
======================

To use the encrypted tokens (JWE), you have to install the [`web-token/jwt-encryption` component](https://github.com/web-token/jwt-encryption).

```sh
composer require web-token/jwt-encryption
```

When this component is installed, encryption algorithms are automatically handles by the Algorithm Manager Factory.
